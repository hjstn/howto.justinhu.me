## Getting Global Entry and TSA PreCheck as an international student.

Global Entry is a U.S. CBP program that allows expedited entry when flying into the United States through automated kiosks. It is available to U.S. citizens, U.S. permanent residents, and citizens of countries listed [here](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/eligibility).

There is a non-refundable $100 application fee for a 5-year membership, and all applicants are subject to a background check and interview. There may be additional requirements based on your nationality listed [here](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/international-arrangements).

The program also includes TSA PreCheck membership ($85 for 5 years), which gives you access to PreCheck-exclusive expedited security lanes.

**Note:** Global Entry is the only way for foreign nationals to be eligible for TSA PreCheck. Only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can apply for PreCheck directly.

**Warning:** Based on your nationality, you may have to complete additional pre-application steps in your home country before you can submit the Global Entry application.

**Warning:** Since the pre-interview application review process can take 90 days or more, submit your application as early as possible if you intend to complete the interview when you next enter the U.S. (Enrollment on Arrival).

### Caveats

#### Students with a Form I-20

If you are on a F-1 visa and use a Global Entry kiosk to enter the U.S., your receipt will be invalid and show "REPORT TO PASSPORT CONTROL" as your Form I-20 must be manually inspected. Proceed through the Global Entry queue and a CBP agent will inspect your passport, visa and Form I-20.

**Note:** If you have to go through the regular passport control queue, you will likely be cut to the front of the line.

**Warning:** If your Form I-20 is not inspected, you may have entered the U.S. with an incorrect Class of Admission. Follow the steps below.

**If your Form I-20 was not inspected:**

1. Check your Form I-94 travel history approximately 3 days after entry [here](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/).
2. If it is not updated with your latest entry into the U.S., find the contact information of your nearest CBP Deferred Inspection Site [here](https://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports/deferred-inspection-sites).
3. Email the Deferred Inspection Site to request an I-94 correction, stating that you entered the U.S. using Global Entry, but your Form I-94 has not been updated. Specify your date of entry, and attach a copy of your passport, U.S. visa, and Form I-20.

### Applying for Global Entry as an International Student

#### Preparation

Required Documents for Global Entry:

1. Passport
2. U.S. Visa (and Form I-20, if applicable)
3. Proof of Residence (Lease, utilities bill, bank statement, etc.)
4. Additional Documents (depending on your nationality)

You should also have this information ready:

1. Address History (past 5 years)
2. Employment History (past 5 years)
3. International Travel History (past 5 years)

#### Completing your Global Entry application

1. Select "Get Started" for the Global Entry application on the Trusted Traveler Program (TTP) website [here](https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/).

2. Ignore the TSA PreCheck prompt, and select "Continue with your Global Entry Application".

3. Fill out the application using the information prepared above as instructed and complete the payment for the application.

4. Your application should now be marked "Pending Review".

**Note:** You may have to wait over 90 days for the review to complete.

#### Completing your Global Entry interview

After your application is reviewed, if you are eligible for Global Entry, your application will be marked with "Conditional Approval". You will receive an email when this happens.

1. Schedule your interview on the TTP website. You can also select Enrollment on Arrival to complete the enrollment when you next arrive in the United States.
	
    **Warning:** The interview date should be within a year of you receiving Conditional Approval.

    **Note:** For UIUC students, the Chicago Enrollment Center is nearby and easily accessible from Chicago Union Station.

2. On the smae website, print your Conditional Approval letter.

3. Bring the Required Documents listed earlier and your Conditional Approval letter to your interview.

4. During the interview, you may be asked brief questions similar to those asked during passport control.

    Sample questions include:

    1. Why do you want Global Entry?
    2. Which university do you attend? What is your major?

5. After your interview, you should expect to receive an Approval email within a day.

**Note:** The interview is brief, and the process should take approximately 30 minutes.

#### After being approved for Global Entry

Using TSA PreCheck:

1. Note down your Known Traveller Number (KTN) on the TTP website. **You must fill this in  to use TSA PreCheck.**
2. FIll your KTN in the appropriate fields **when booking flight tickets or checking in** with eligible airlines listed [here](https://www.tsa.gov/precheck/participating-airlines).
3. Ensure that your boarding pass says "TSA PRECHK" and includes your KTN.

Entering the U.S. using Global Entry:

1. Do **not** fill out the Customs Declaration form if it is provided to you in-flight.

2. Follow the signage towards the Global Entry kiosks. Some airport staff may not be aware that foreign nationals are eligible for Global Entry.

3. Follow the instructions on the kiosk. You will scan your passport information page, and a picture of you will be taken. Remove your glasses.

4. Collect your receipt from the kiosk. If you have a Form I-20, note the caveat highlighted earlier.

5. Submit your Global Entry receipt instead of the Customs Declaration form at the Customs counter while leaving the airport.
