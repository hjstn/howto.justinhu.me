This is a collection of How-to guides written by Justin Hu.

While similar guides exist (and you should definitely read them too), these guides includes fine-print details and caveats from my own experiences and headaches, highlighting things that I wish I knew when I was figuring things out.

While I try to ensure that the information is accurate, some details may be missed or become outdated. You should also consult other resources.
